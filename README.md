# odin-recipes

A basic recipe website.

This is the first project in the Odin Project and I hope to learn mainly about using git while working on a project. I already have experience with html/css/javascript etc. but I don't have much with git.

I hope to improve my sills with git and hopefully revisit this at a later date with updated CSS & JavaScript.

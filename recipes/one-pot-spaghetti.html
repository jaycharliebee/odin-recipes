    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Want spaghetti but don’t have the energy to boil water, drain pasta, and
      make a from-scratch sauce? Us either!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Try our simplified take on spaghetti made in 1 pot with plenty of veggies,
      perfectly al dente spaghetti noodles, and hearty marinara sauce. Top with
      vegan parmesan cheese and fresh basil for the ultimate 30-minute weeknight
      meal! Perfect for making ahead and enjoying throughout the week. Let us
      show you how it’s done!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 Tbsp olive oil (if oil-free, sub broth or water and add more as needed
        to prevent sticking)
      </li>
      <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>
        2 ½ cups cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced (or sub white button mushrooms
        // ~8 ounces as original recipe is written)
      </li>
      <li>1 medium yellow or red bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>
        1/2 tsp sea salt (plus more to taste — keep in mind that your marinara
        will be salted)
      </li>
      <li>1 tsp dried oregano (or Italian seasoning blend)</li>
      <li>
        1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (reduce for less heat // increase for
        more heat)
      </li>
      <li>
        2 (24-oz.) jars favorite marinara (we like Rao’s and Organico Bello
        brands)
      </li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>
        12 oz. dry gluten-free spaghetti (we like Jovial brand or Barillo // sub
        any pasta shape you like here)
      </li>
      <li>1 big handful spinach or other green of choice (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large pot (with a lid) over medium heat. Once hot, add the oil
        and wait 30 seconds. Then add the onion and sauté 4-5 minutes or until
        lightly browned and translucent, stirring occasionally. Turn down heat
        as needed if browning too quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic, mushrooms, bell pepper, and salt and stir. Sauté, stirring
        frequently, until softened and slightly caramelized ~5-7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the oregano and red pepper flakes and stir until fragrant, about 1
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the marinara and water and bring to a simmer. Break the pasta in
        half (disregard if using a smaller pasta shape) and add to the pot. Stir
        to break up any clumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add optional greens at this time if desired. Then cover the pot, reduce
        heat to low, and simmer for 13 minutes, stirring twice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and let the pot stand, covered, for 2 minutes. Stir
        again to break up any remaining clumps of pasta (clumping should be
        minimal at this point). Uncover, taste, and adjust the seasonings as
        needed with more salt for overall flavor, oregano for herbal flavor, or
        red pepper flakes for heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with fresh basil and vegan parmesan on top (optional). Store
        cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days and reheat in the
        microwave or on the stovetop until hot, adding more water as needed to
        thin. Not freezer friendly.
